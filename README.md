# Ingestion Modules

## üõ†Ô∏è Overview

This repository contains production-grade, thoroughly tested, and deployed modules designed for seamless data ingestion from various sources to AWS Redshift and S3. Developed for a leading healthcare company's Big Data platform, the modules focus on ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) workflows.

The codebase is hosted on AWS EC2, aligning with the company's AWS-based infrastructure. Each module is rigorously tested in an non-production environment and deployed to production through a robust *CI/CD* pipeline. These modules form the backbone of the organization's data ingestion processes, ensuring scalability, reliability, and performance.
